*Q. What is this?
*A. Did you read the thing at the top of this document?  That's what it is.  It's the Development Branch for the LinuxBBQ's "Roaster" Web-Browser.  More accuratly, it's a Python-based browser that's lightweight and extremely hackable.


*Q. My config file doesn't work/some buttons don't work/foobar_function is broken.
*A. Say it with me, "Development Branch"...we're working on it.  If you would like to submit an issue, then feel free.  We'll look into it.


*Q. I'd like to add (_______) feature.
*A. Then by all means, add it.  If you want it in the main line program, put in a pull request.

*Q. How do I get it to run?
*A. It is set to run by default in many LinuxBBQ distributions.  <http://www.linuxbbq.org>  If you'd like to run it as a script, then satisfy all of the imports, cd to the directory that the script is located, and run that bad mama-jama.

*Q. How do I run it on Windows/Macintosh systems?
*A. On the 13th of the month, at midnight, make 2 circles of salted leather strips.  Sacrifice a virgin, and draw a pentagram on the floor with her blood.  Then, repeat these lines, "Oh Overlord Satan, I beg of thee...make roaster run under Windows/Macintosh."  Report back with your findings.  Add "your soul" to the list of things to import.  I've not tried it, but it works in theory.

*Q. Will you please _______?
*A. Probably not, but you can always ask.
